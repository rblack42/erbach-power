Plotter
#######

The **Plotter** class provides a simple way to display graphs produced by th
program. The available graphs include airfoil lift/drag polars, :math:`Cl/\alpha`,
:math:`C_d/\alpha` plots. In the analysis segment of the program, we will be able to
set up parametric studies, and display the results in a variety of ways. Most
of this power isprovided by a combination of **numpy** and **matplotlib**, two
powerful packages hugely popular with data scientists.

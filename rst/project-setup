Project Setup
#############

The first step in creating a Python application involves setting up the project
directory. I use simple command line tools to manage my projects, so we will
begin this setup by making (pun intended) sure that **make** works properly.

Step 1: Name the Project
************************

For this example, rhe project name will be **erbach-power**. I keep all active
projects in a directory named **_dev** in my home directory. (The **_** in
front of that name keeps this directory near the top od the folder list when
using Windows Explorer, Mac *Finder*, or a directory listing from the command
line.

..	code-block:: shell

	$ cd ~/_dev
	$ mkdir -perbach-power
	$ cd erbach-power

The **-p** option on the **mkdir** line lets you run this set of commands over
and over without problems. This is important to me, since my documentation
actually runs these commands when i build the web pages for this project. We
will cover documentation soon enough.

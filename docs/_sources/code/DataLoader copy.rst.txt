Notes
*****

This module manages loading model and airfoil data for analysis. These data
files have a very simple structure: one line that identifies the data, followed
by a series of lines with **x-y** values defining the data curve.

Data Directory Path
===================

The program will search for data files in one of three places, searched in
this order:

* A location defined by the **MATHMAGIC** environment variable

* The **MathMagik** directory in the user's home directory

* The **data** directory in the **mmflight** application source code directory.

The default data provided in that last directory was extracted from Erbach's
original Basic code.

For this program, the required data files will be located in the **model** and
**airfoils** subdirectories.

Data File Format
================

The data files are simple text files containing point data for the curve
define. The first line in the file includes the Rname of the curve defined.
The curve is defined by a series of lines, each containing the **x **y values,
space separated.
